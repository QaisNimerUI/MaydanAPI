// Association.cs, AssociationConfiguration.cs, and a bare IAssociationRepository/AssociationRepository
// (GetByIdAsync/GetAllAsync/AddAsync/Remove only) already existed — this class, AssociationsController,
// and the repository's search/sort/soft-delete-aware query additions are what Phase 2a actually adds.
//
// Deliberately NOT built here (see this pass's own completion report for the full list): Association
// admin-creation (already exists — EntityOnboardingController's associations/without-admin +
// associations/{id}/admin, built during the onboarding phase; do not duplicate it), AssociationUsers
// linking (Phase 2b — no AssociationUser entity exists yet; Phase 2c's own investigation confirmed
// "users associated with an association" are simply real User rows with EntityType.Association +
// EntityId == association.Id, Phase 2b's own real wiring), CityLocations (a later phase — Association
// has no CityLocationId column; see AssociationDto's own comment), and the Service-Request-based
// edit/delete restriction (MAYD-48/50 — no ServiceRequest module exists anywhere in this codebase
// yet, confirmed by grep).
//
// MAYD-51 (Association Management, Phase 2c, 2026-09-26): "Delete Associated Users & Workers" — see
