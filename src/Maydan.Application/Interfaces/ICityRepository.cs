    // could theoretically appear in the public signup dropdown as a result; accepted rather than
    // splitting this into two endpoints, because RegisterAsync's own City lookup (GetByIdAsync,
    // active-only, unchanged above) would still correctly reject it, and
    // ProductionHouseSignupComponent.applyServerError already has a dedicated

    // a generic error banner — this edge case was already anticipated on the frontend.
