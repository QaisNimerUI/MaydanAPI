// belong to any single one of their own services. LocationService's "one cohesive service per
// feature area" reasoning (City is FK'd to Country, one frontend page drives both) doesn't apply
// here: Project and the supervising User are peers linked by a new junction entity, not a
// parent/child pair under one page.
