            //   Association + ProductionHouse only, the two entities in the double-verification

            // cross-entity VIEW-only oversight over Associations/ProductionHouse, which stays

            // RolePermissions ∪ UserPermissions ∪ GroupPermissions union with no per-user revoke, so
            // anything granted at the ROLE level is automatically held by EVERY ASEZA user, admin
            // and regular alike — no "custom subset" is possible for a role-level grant. These 7 are
            // instead granted directly to the seeded ASEZA admin (UserId 1000) as individual
            // UserPermissions (see UserSeedConfiguration.cs's own migration for this ticket) — a
            // fresh regular ASEZA user now genuinely starts with none of them, and the admin assigns
            // a real subset via the existing, already-verified User Details "Edit Permissions" flow
            // (MAYD-34) — UpdateDirectPermissionsAsync/GetAvailablePermissionsAsync were extended

            // personally does.
